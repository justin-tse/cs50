The CS50 Duck has been stolen! The town of Fiftyville has called upon you to solve the mystery of the stolen duck. Authorities believe that the thief stole the duck and then, shortly afterwards, took a flight out of town with the help of an accomplice. Your goal is to identify:
1. Who the thief is,
2. What city the thief escaped to, and
3. Who the thief's accomplice is who helped them escape

All you know is that the theft took place on July 28
and that it took place on Chamberlin Street.
Come up with a list of suspects.

Answer:
1. Who the thief is,
SELECT id FROM crime_scene_reports WHERE street = "Chamberlin Street" AND month = 7 and day = 28;
id
295

id | year | month | day | street | description
295 | 2020 | 7 | 28 | Chamberlin Street | Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Chamberlin Street courthouse. Interviews were conducted today with three witnesses who were present at the time â€” each of their interview transcripts mentions the courthouse.

SELECT id FROM interviews WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 and day = 28;

SELECT id FROM courthouse_security_logs WHERE hour = 10 AND minute = 15;

2. What city the thief escaped to, and
3. Who the thief's accomplice is who helped them escape


TEACHER:
SELECT id FROM crime_scene_reports WHERE street = "Chamberlin Street" AND month = 7 and day = 28;

SELECT * FROM interviews WHERE month = 7 AND day = 28 AND transcript LIKE "%courthouse%";

SELECT id FROM courthouse_security_logs WHERE hour = 10 AND minute = 15;

sqlite> SELECT id FROM courthouse_security_logs WHERE hour = 10 AND minute = 15;

sqlite> SELECT * FROM courthouse_security_logs WHERE id = 459;
id | year | month | day | hour | minute | activity | license_plate
459 | 2020 | 7 | 31 | 10 | 15 | exit | 11J91FW

.schema people

SELECT name FROM people WHERE license_plate IN
(SELECT license_plate FROM courthouse_security_logs WHERE month = 7 AND day = 28
AND hour = 10 AND minute >= 15 AND minute <= 25 AND activity = "exit");
