### [My Project ](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/471289484/)
The project is about playing basketball and fun to learn. 
When you go to the basketball playground. After you finish the first shot or dunk, you could choose to play this game.
1. Click the girl to dunk.
2. Hit the spacebar to shot the ball. 
3. When the total number of dunk and shot is more than or equal to 6, you will have a surprise.
